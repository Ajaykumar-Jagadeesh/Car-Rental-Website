                <h3>A class of small sport utility vehicles</h3>
                <p>A compact SUV still has good cargo room and a spacious interior, but with smaller dimensions and <br>more fuel-efficient engines. That makes them ideal for those<br> who live in more urban areas or have long commutes. They're also more affordable,<br> with lots of budget-friendly used options.SUVs are able to take <br> the force of a collision more effectively than smaller cars <br>due to them being larger and heavier, reducing the chance of injury for all occupants.</p>

                <p>Most compact SUVs come with two rows, which can only accommodate four people comfortably. <br>To occupy five people, the fifth person has to squeeze in the rear middle seat,<br> which is not usually comfortable, especially if they are chubby adult passengers.<br>In terms of seating capacity, compact SUVs are generally five-seater cars.<br> Some of the examples of compact SUVs include Tata Nexon, Nissan Magnite, Kia Seltos, etc.</p>
